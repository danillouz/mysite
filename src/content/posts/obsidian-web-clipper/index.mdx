import Bookmarklet from "./Bookmarklet"

I recently started using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) and I like it a lot! One thing I was missing though, was to quickly save (i.e. "clip") a webpage to Obsidian from my browser. So I was happy to find Stephan Ango's [Obsidian web clipper](https://stephanango.com/obsidian-web-clipper) which does just that (thanks Stephan!).

Stephan's web clipper works pretty well, but I wanted slightly different behavior. And since the web clipper is an open source bookmarklet, it was easy for me to modify.

## What is a bookmarklet?

A [bookmarklet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet) is a browser bookmark that runs some JavaScript code every time you click it.

You can create a bookmarklet by creating a new bookmark in your browser, but instead of providing a link to a website, you give it a `javascript` URI. For example:

```js
javascript: alert("Go eat ice cream!")
```

So the bookmarklet above would show a "Go eat ice cream!" alert every time you click it (and I highly recommend you install it).

## My Obsidian web clipper

My version of the bookmarklet is based on Stephan Ango's [Obsidian web clipper](https://gist.github.com/kepano/90c05f162c37cf730abb8ff027987ca3), so it does pretty much the same thing, but with these differences:

- npm dependencies are loaded as ECMAScript modules from [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/?docs=esm).
- Clippings of entire webpages, and clippings of selections are stored in _separate_ Obsidian folders: `Clippings` and `Clippings/Quotes`.
- Clippings of selections (quotes) of the same webpage are _appended_ to the same Obsidian note.
- Quotes include the selected [text fragment](https://web.dev/text-fragments/) in the source link. So visiting the quote's source link will scroll you to, and highlight, the clipped text on the webpage. This only works natively in Chromium and Safari, but [this browser extension](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/link-to-text-fragment#installation) can be installed to polyfill the functionality.
- An alert dialog will show when clipping fails.

### How to use it?

1. Drag this link to your bookmarks: <Bookmarklet />.
2. Visit a webpage:

   a. To clip an entire webpage: click the bookmark.

   b. To only clip part of a webpage: first select some text (can include images), then click the bookmark.

### Known issues

- Clipping does not work on webpages that enable [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) (CSP), which block inline scripts (e.g. you can't clip Reddit and Twitter posts).
- Clipping selections does not work in Safari. Because Safari's confirmation dialog "unselects" any content before clipping (so it always clips the entire webpage).

### The code

Feel free to remix the code below. And after changing the code, you can turn it into a bookmarklet with [Make Bookmarklets](https://make-bookmarklets.com/).
