[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) provides a [Command Line Interface](https://www.sqlite.org/cli.html) (CLI) program named `sqlite3`. And it's already installed on most operating systems.

## Basic usage

The CLI can be run with or without command line options (flags).

When a flag is provided, it must be prefixed with `-` or `--`. For example, `-version` and `--version` do the same thing:

```sh
sqlite3 -version
```

When `sqlite3` is run without flags, it will connect to a temporary in-memory database (which will be deleted on exit) in **interactive mode**:

```sh
sqlite3

SQLite version 3.37.0 2021-12-09 01:34:53
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
Connected to a transient in-memory database.
Use ".open FILENAME" to reopen on a persistent database.

sqlite>
```

When in interactive mode, the prompt is `sqlite>` and it reads text input from the keyboard:

- SQL statements.
- Dot commands like `.open` (where some dot commands also accept flags).

But it's also possible to redirect `sqlite3` I/O (input/output) to:

- [Read SQL statements from a file](#read-sql-statements-from-a-file).
- [Write results to a file](#write-results-to-a-file).

### Help

To see how to use the CLI (and print all available CLI flags):

```sh
sqlite3 -help
```

To print all available dot commands (in interactive mode):

```sh
sqlite> .help
```

To see how to use a dot command (in interactive mode), and print available dot command flags, run `.help DOT_COMMAND`. For example:

```sh
sqlite> .help .import
```

## Open a database

When a filename is provided to the `sqlite3` command, it will either create a new database or open an existing database in interactive mode:

```sh
sqlite3 mydb
```

In interactive mode, a connection to a new or existing database can always be created via the `.open` dot command. And to connect to a temporary in-memory database, use `:memory:` as the database file name.

To destroy any data in an existing database run `.open -new FILENAME`. For example:

```sh
sqlite> .open -new existingdb
```

To open a database in read-only mode use the `-readonly` flag:

```sh
sqlite3 -readonly mydb
```

This also works in interactive mode:

```sh
sqlite> .open -readonly myotherdb
```

## Databases and schemas

To see all databases in interactive mode:

```sh
sqlite> .databases
```

To see all tables (including [attached databases](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_attach.html)):

```sh
sqlite> .tables
```

To see all indexes:

```sh
sqlite> .indexes
sqlite> .indexes tablename
```

To see the complete schema of the database (including attached databases):

```sh
sqlite> .schema
sqlite> .schema tablename
```

## Read SQL statements from a file

In interactive mode the `.read` dot command can be used:

```sh
sqlite> .read script.sql
```

Besides SQL statements, the file may also contain dot commands.

### Pipe input

If the argument to `.read` begins with the pipe symbol `|`, then instead of opening the argument as a file, it runs the argument as a command, and uses the output of that command as its input.

## Write results to a file

By default `sqlite3` sends all output to "standard output", but this can be changed via the `.output` and `.once` dot commands.

To output _all_ query results to a file:

```sh
sqlite> .mode list
sqlite> .separator ,
sqlite> .output books_and_authors.txt
sqlite> select * from books;
sqlite> select * from authors;
sqlite> .exit
```

To do the above just once, use the `.once` dot command instead.

### Pipe results

If the argument to `.output` or `.once` begins with the pipe symbol `|`, then it runs the argument as a command, and the output is sent to that command.

## Load file content into a table column

The `readfile()` function loads file content as a `BLOB`:

```sh
sqlite> CREATE TABLE images(
sqlite> name TEXT,
sqlite> type TEXT,
sqlite> img BLOB
sqlite> );
sqlite>
sqlite> INSERT INTO images(name,type,img)
sqlite> VALUES('icon','png',readfile('icon.png'));
```

## Write a table column to a file

The `writefile()` function writes a column value to a file:

```sh
sqlite> SELECT writefile('icon.png',img) FROM images WHERE name='icon';
```

## Import CSV

```sh
sqlite> .import -csv file.csv tablename
```

To import into a table in a different database use `-schema`. This specifies that the table is part of another "schema" (useful for attached databases or to import into a temporary table).

## Export CSV

```sh
sqlite> .headers on
sqlite> .mode csv
sqlite> .once ~/data.csv
sqlite>
sqlite> SELECT * FROM table;
sqlite>
sqlite> .system open ~/data.csv
```

## Dump and restore a database

Dump (converts entire database content into a single UTF-8 text file):

```sh
sqlite3 mydb .dump | gzip -c > mydb.dump.gz
```

Restore:

```sh
zcat mydb.dump.gz | sqlite3 mydb
```

## Configuration

An `.sqliterc` resource file can be created in the "home directory" to configure dot command settings. For example to change the output format:

```ini title="~/.sqliterc"
.mode box
```

After creating the `.sqliterc` file, it will be loaded on startup:

```sh
sqlite3 mydb

-- Loading resources from /Users/daniel/.sqliterc
SQLite version 3.37.0 2021-12-09 01:34:53
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
